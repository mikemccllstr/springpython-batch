Spring Batch Python
===================

This is a Pythonic implementation of the `Spring Batch
<http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/>`_ batch job framework.

To quote the Spring Batch documentation:

  Many applications within the enterprise domain require bulk
  processing to perform business operations in mission critical
  environments. These business operations include automated, complex
  processing of large volumes of information that is most efficiently
  processed without user interaction. These operations typically
  include time based events (e.g. month-end calculations, notices or
  correspondence), periodic application of complex business rules
  processed repetitively across very large data sets (e.g. insurance
  benefit determination or rate adjustments), or the integration of
  information that is received from internal and external systems that
  typically requires formatting, validation and processing in a
  transactional manner into the system of record. Batch processing is
  used to process billions of transactions every day for enterprises.
